## Description ##

This plugin allows you to send notifications to [HipChat](https://hipchat.com) rooms when certain events in WordPress occur. By default, there are three events that can be sent to HipChat:

1. When a post needs review (status transitioned to 'pending')
1. When a post is published
1. When there's a new comment

It's possible to add more events using `hipchat_get_events` filter.

**Development of this plugin is done on [GitHub](https://github.com/gedex/wp-better-hipchat). Pull requests are always welcome**.

There's a [HipChat plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/hipchat/) that's released by HipChat. Unfortunately there's no repository that allows me to make contribution to that plugin. In latest release, v1.2, the official plugin only notifies one room whenever a post is published and uses old REST API. **Better HipChat** plugin is developed to remove the limitations that official plugin has.

## Installation ##

1. Upload **Better HipChat** plugin to your blog's `wp-content/plugins/` directory and activate.
1. Get **Room Notification Token** in your HipChat, the URL is `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.hipchat.com/admin/rooms` (replace `<SUBDOMAIN>` with your HipChat's subdomain). Click the room that you want to be notified. On the left sidebar there's **Tokens** link. Put the label in which it will be used as the name of the notifier. Note the generated token.
1. Go to **Better HipChat** menu in your WordPress to add the integration (make sure you're logged in as an Administrator).
